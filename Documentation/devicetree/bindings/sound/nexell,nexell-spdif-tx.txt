Nexell Sony/Philips Digital Interface Format (S/PDIF) Controller

The Nexell S/PDIF audio block is a stereo transceiver that allows the
processor to receive and transmit digital audio via an coaxial cable or
a fibre cable.

Required properties:

- compatible: Compatible list, must contain "nexell,nexell-spdif-tx".
- reg: Offset and length of the register set for the device.
- interrupts: Contains the spdif interrupt.
- dmas: Generic dma devicetree binding as described in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/dma/dma.txt.
- dma-names: Two dmas have to be defined, "tx" and "rx".
- clocks: Contains an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: spdiftx uses some base clks from CMU and some are from audio
  subsystem internal clock controller. The clock names for i2s0 should be
  "spdif-tx" as shown in the example below.
- resets: phandle to the parent reset controller.
- "nexell_reset" - reset-controller,
  - "RESET_ID_SPDIFTX" - Nth Reset control id (N = 0, 1, ...)
- reset-names: input names of resets used by the controller

Optional Properties:

- pinctrl-0: Should specify pin control groups used for this controller.
- pinctrl-names: Should contain only one value - "default".
- pcm-bit : Select pcm bit. (16/24 bits)
- sample-rate : Select sample rate. (44100~96000hz)

Example:

spdiftx@c0059000 {
	compatible = "nexell,nexell-spdif-tx";
	reg = <PHYS_BASE_SPDIF_TX 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 IRQ_SPDIFTX 0>;
	dmas = <&pl08xdma1 6>;
	dma-names = "tx";
	resets = <&nexell_reset RESET_ID_SPDIFTX>;
	reset-names = "spdiftx-reset";
	clocks = <&spdiftx>;
	clock-names = "spdif-tx";
	pinctrl-names = "default";
	pinctrl-0 = <&spdiftx_pin>;
	pcm-bit = <16>;
	sample_rate = <48000>;
	status = "okay";
};
