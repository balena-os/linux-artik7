* Nexell tieoff.

Tieoff block is a set of registers that includes special registers which
 donâ€™t need to be set in normal mode operation.
Tieoff block includes special function registers for ARM, HDMI, DRAM controller,
 UART, USB2.0 HOST controller/ Phy, USB2.0 OTG controller/ Phy,
 Ethernet controller, AXI buses and the internal SRAM timing margin controls.

Add the following properties for each device node using the tieoff.

Required properties:

- compatible: should be "nexell,tieoff".
- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.
- soc,tieoff: add to device node of each driver, <tieoff index, tieoff value>
  so on. You can find defines of tieoff index
  at dt-bindings/tieoff/s5p6818-tieoff.h and tieoff value is device specific so
  refer to TRM.

Example:
	tieoff@c0011000 {
		compatible = "nexell,tieoff";
		reg = <PHYS_BASE_TIEOFF 0x1000>;
	};

	serial0:serial@c00a1000 {
		....
		soc,tieoff = <NX_TIEOFF_UART0_USESMC 0>,
			     <NX_TIEOFF_UART0_SMCTXENB 0>,
			     <NX_TIEOFF_UART0_SMCRXENB 0>;
	}
