Secure Element Control driver for S3T9MF

This binding defines secure element control interface to control ARTIK's
secure element(eq. S3T9MF).

Required properties:
- compatible : "samsung,s3t9mf"
- reset-gpio: Reset GPIO pin
- pwms : PWM property to point to the PWM device (phandle)/port (id) and to
  specify the period time to be used: <&phandle id period_ns>;
- pwm-names : (optional) Name to be used by the PWM subsystem for the PWM device
  For the pwms and pwm-names property please refer to:
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pwm/pwm.txt

Example:
	artik_s3t9mf {
		compatible = "samsung,s3t9mf";
		reset-gpio = <&gpio_b 26 0>;
		pwms = <&pwm 1 121 0>
		pwm-names = "pwm_t9mf";
		status = "okay";
	};
