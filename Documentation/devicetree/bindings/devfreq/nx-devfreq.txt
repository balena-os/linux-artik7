Nexell S5Pxx18 series SoC devfreq Device Tree bindings
======================================================

The Nexell S5Pxx18 series SoCs can change bus clock dynamically with this driver.

Required properties:
- compatible	: must contain "nexell,s5pxx18-devfreq"
- pll		: the number of pll that is origin of bus clock
- supply_name	: the name of target supply that is changed dynamically,
		  always "vdd_arm_regulator"
- vdd_arm_regulator-supply : reference to regulator node
- status	: default is "disabled". when using, set to "okay"

Example:

        nx-devfreq {
	        compatible = "nexell,s5pxx18-devfreq";
	        pll = <0>;
		supply_name = "vdd_arm_regulator";
		vdd_arm_regulator-supply = <&VCC_DCDC1>;
	        status = "okay";
	};
