* Nexell SPI Controller

The Samsung SPI controller is used to interface with various devices such as flash
and display controllers using the SPI communication interface.

The Nexell's SPI controller is used same to Samsung SPI contoller.

Required SoC Specific Properties:

- compatible: should be one of the following.
    - nexell,s5p6818-spi - s5p6818 SoC,

- reg: physical base address of the controller and length of memory mapped
  region.

- interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
  depends on the interrupt controller.

- dmas : Two or more DMA channel specifiers following the convention outlined
  in bindings/dma/dma.txt

- dma-names: Names for the dma channels. There must be at least one channel
  named "tx" for transmit and named "rx" for receive.

- resets : phandle to the parent reset controller. SPI has 2 channel reset controls.
 - "nxp_reset" - reset-cotroller,
  - "RESET_ID_SPI<N>_P" - Nth Pre reset control id (N = 0, 1, ...)
  - "RESET_ID_SPI<N>" - Nth Reset control id (N = 0, 1, ...)
- reset-names : input names of resets used by the controller.
	There must has 2 channel named  "pre-reset", "spi-reset".

Required Board Specific Properties:

- #address-cells: should be 1.
- #size-cells: should be 0.

Optional Board Specific Properties:

- samsung,spi-src-clk: If the spi controller includes a internal clock mux to
  select the clock source for the spi bus clock, this property can be used to
  indicate the clock to be used for driving the spi bus clock. If not specified,
  the clock number 0 is used as default.

- num-cs: Specifies the number of chip select lines supported. If
  not specified, the default number of chip select lines is set to 1.

- cs-gpios: should specify GPIOs used for chipselects (see spi-bus.txt)

SPI Controller specific data in SPI slave nodes:

- The spi slave nodes should provide the following information which is required
  by the spi controller.

  - samsung,spi-feedback-delay: The sampling phase shift to be applied on the
    miso line (to account for any lag in the miso line). The following are the
    valid values.

      - 0: No phase shift.
      - 1: 90 degree phase shift sampling.
      - 2: 180 degree phase shift sampling.
      - 3: 270 degree phase shift sampling.

Aliases:

- All the SPI controller nodes should be represented in the aliases node using
  the following format 'spi{n}' where n is a unique number for the alias.


Example:

- SoC Specific Portion:
	spi_0:spi@c005b000 {
		compatible = "nexell,s5p6818-spi";
		reg = <PHYS_BASE_SSP0 0x100>;
		interrupts = <0 IRQ_SSP0 0>;
		dmas = <&pl08xdma0 6>, <&pl08xdma0 7>;
		dma-names = "tx", "rx";
		resets = <&nexell_reset RESET_ID_SSP0_P>,
		       <&nexell_reset RESET_ID_SSP0>;
		reset-names = "pre-reset","spi-reset";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		samsung,spi-src-clk = <0>;
		num-cs = <1>;
		clocks = <&spi0>, <&spi0>;
		clock-names = "spi", "spi_busclk0";
		pinctrl-names = "default";
		pinctrl-0 = <&spi0_bus>;
		status ="disable";
	};

- Board Specific Portion:

	spi_0:spi@c005b000 {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		cs-gpios = <&gpio_c 30 0>;
		status = "okay";

		spidev0@0 {
			compatible ="rohm,dh2228fv";
			reg = <0>;
			spi-max-frequency = <50000000>;
			controller-data {
				smasung,spi-feedback-delay = <02>;
			};
		};
	};
